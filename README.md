# DeltaRace
7 Days Ultra Casual Mobile Game Challenge on Unity

# Technical Constraints
- Camera : Behind and on the side of the player (approx. -45 Y angle)
- Controls : Hold to dive, release to fly up => inversed in my implementation because it's more natural in my opinion
- Character : Your speed increases during your dive. So you have to try to
maximize your dives to overtake opponents. You can also pick up boosters.
